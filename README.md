# Botched-Pong
A recreation of pong in C++ with SDL.

This is a semi-authentic recreation of pong, made in C++ in SDL. 
This is probably my first 'actual' project, excluding a few bots I made here and there.
This took me a few months bc I'm too lazy to work on anything consistently.

I thought calling checkPhysics() inside of moveBall() would have been a good idea, and maybe it was the right choice, but I think it ended up causing more problems than necessary.
I also tried to optimize the actual speed of the game while writing this, but I can't say for sure if what I did helped or not.
In general, the code was alright, but it definitely needs improvement. 
Not sure if I want to go to college for comp sci or not :/
